# Repetition Loop Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The chatbot was getting stuck in repetitive loops, asking the same questions repeatedly:
- Asking for the user's name multiple times
- Repeating "What's your ideal timeline or deadline for this project?"
- Triggering the same strategic responses repeatedly

## Root Causes
1. **No conversation state tracking** - The bot didn't remember what it had already asked
2. **Strategic response system** - Same triggers were firing repeatedly for the same keywords
3. **RFP flow** - No mechanism to detect when users were being repetitive or unresponsive
4. **Contact capture** - No tracking of whether contact info had already been requested

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Strategic Response State Tracking (`lib/responses.ts`)
- Added `ConversationState` interface to track conversation history
- Modified `findStrategicResponse()` to accept `sessionId` parameter
- Added repetitive response detection (30-second window)
- Added user response detection (prevents strategic responses to "yes", "no", "thanks", etc.)
- Added conversation state management with memory limits

### 2. RFP Flow Improvements (`lib/rfpService.ts`)
- Added conversation state tracking to `RFPFlowState`
- Added `addUserResponse()` method to track user behavior
- Added `isUserRepetitive()` method to detect repetitive/vague responses
- Added `shouldSkipStep()` method to advance flow when user is unresponsive
- Added similarity calculation to detect repeated responses

### 3. Contact Capture Prevention (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Added session log checking to prevent asking for contact info multiple times
- Added `hasAskedForContact` detection using log analysis
- Prevents contact capture if already requested in current session

### 4. RFP Pivot Prevention (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Added session log checking to prevent offering RFP multiple times
- Added `hasOfferedRFP` detection using log analysis
- Prevents RFP pivot if already offered in current session

### 5. Enhanced RFP Flow Management (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Added automatic step advancement when user is being repetitive
- Added user response tracking in RFP flow
- Added fallback values when user is unresponsive

## Key Features

### Conversation State Management
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  lastStrategicResponse?: string;
  lastStrategicTrigger?: string;
  strategicResponseCount: number;
  lastResponseTime: number;
  userResponses: string[];
}
```

### Repetitive Response Detection
- 30-second window for same trigger prevention
- User response detection (yes, no, thanks, etc.)
- Similarity calculation for repeated content
- Memory management (keeps last 5-10 responses)

### Automatic Flow Advancement
- Detects when user is being vague or repetitive
- Automatically advances to next step after 2 repetitive responses
- Provides fallback values for unresponsive users

## Testing
Created `test-repetition-fix.js` to verify:
- Same message doesn't trigger same strategic response twice
- User responses don't trigger strategic responses
- State clearing works correctly

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates repetitive loops** - Bot remembers what it has asked
2. **Improves user experience** - No more asking the same question repeatedly
3. **Maintains conversation flow** - Automatic advancement when user is stuck
4. **Reduces frustration** - Users won't feel like the bot is broken
5. **Preserves functionality** - All original features still work

## Usage
The fixes are automatically applied when:
- Strategic responses are triggered
- RFP flow is active
- Contact capture is attempted
- RFP pivot is offered

No changes needed to existing code - all fixes are backward compatible.
