# Random Client Mentions Fix

## üêõ Issue Description

The bot was randomly mentioning clients and past work that weren't relevant to the user's specific needs, creating confusing and off-topic responses.

**Example of the problem:**
```
User: "we just need a brand refresh"
Bot: "A brand refresh can be a great way to revitalize your existing identity and appeal to new audiences. We've helped similar projects in the past, such as Experience Maple Grove, where we did year-round creative and digital marketing, including Restaurant Week and Winter Fest."
```

**Problem:** The user is asking about a skate shop brand refresh, but the bot randomly brings up Experience Maple Grove's marketing campaigns, which have nothing to do with branding or skate shops.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **over-eager client showcasing**:

1. **Lack of Contextual Relevance**: The bot was mentioning clients without checking if they're relevant to the user's specific needs
2. **Showcase Mentality**: The bot was trying to demonstrate past work even when it wasn't helpful
3. **Missing Focus Guidelines**: No clear instructions to stay focused on the user's project
4. **Generic Responses**: Using template responses that mention clients regardless of relevance

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompt**
Added explicit instructions to prevent random client mentions:

```typescript
IMPORTANT: Never randomly mention clients or past work unless they're specifically relevant to what the user is asking about. Focus on the user's needs, not on showcasing past projects.

SPECIFIC RULES:
- For brand refresh conversations: Focus on the user's specific needs, don't randomly mention unrelated clients
- For skate shop/branding discussions: Stay focused on their project, don't bring up unrelated marketing campaigns
- Only mention past work when it directly relates to what the user is asking about
```

### 2. **Contextual Relevance Guidelines**
Added new strategic response guidelines:

- **NO RANDOM CLIENT MENTIONS**: Never randomly mention clients unless they're specifically relevant to the user's project or question
- **CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE**: Only mention clients when they directly relate to what the user is asking about
- **FOCUS ON USER'S NEEDS**: Keep responses focused on the user's specific project, not on showcasing past work
