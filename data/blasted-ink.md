# Blasted Ink ‚Äì Custom Tattoo Shop Branding

**Client:** Blasted Ink  
**Location:** Mall of America (originally University Ave, St. Paul, MN)  
**Project Type:** Visual Identity, Custom Typography, Artistic Branding  

## The Origin Story

Blasted Ink first came to us in 2015 as a small shop on University Ave in St. Paul. What they wanted wasn‚Äôt a cookie-cutter logo‚Äîthey wanted a brand that felt as **custom, bold, and artistic** as their tattoos.

## The Brand Identity

We developed a **fully hand-drawn typographic system**, built around expressive letterforms and gritty precision. The standout: a custom ‚ÄúB‚Äù that became the heart of the identity. Every curve, stroke, and shadow was intentional, capturing their edge and expertise.

## Design Strategy

- **Handcrafted Typography:** No fonts‚Äîjust form. We explored lettering styles, refined shapes, and found a style that felt both timeless and tattoo-forward.
- **Color System:** A distinctive palette that stood apart from the black-on-black typical in tattoo shops.
- **Voice & Feel:** Confident, raw, and refined‚Äîtheir brand became a reflection of the skill behind the needle.

## Evolution & Impact

As Blasted Ink grew and opened a **location inside the Mall of America**, the brand identity followed‚Äîloud and unmistakable. It now lives as signage, merch, web, and storefront, making them easily one of the most recognizable tattoo shops in the country.
