# Strategic Response System

## Overview

The strategic response system provides context-rich, confident, and curiosity-driven responses to pricing and service-related questions. It replaces vague or generic replies with strategic messaging that aligns with Clubhaus's voice and approach.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Detection**: User messages are checked against predefined trigger phrases
2. **Priority Override**: Strategic responses take priority over RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) when triggered
3. **Curiosity-Driven**: All responses end with follow-up questions to encourage conversation
4. **Tone Consistency**: Responses maintain Clubhaus's confident, curious, and concise voice

## Adding New Responses

To add a new strategic response:

1. **Edit `/lib/responses.ts`**
2. **Add to `STRATEGIC_RESPONSES` array**:
   ```typescript
   {
     triggers: ["trigger phrase 1", "trigger phrase 2"],
     response: "Your strategic response here...",
     followUp: "Your follow-up question here?"
   }
   ```

3. **Follow the tone guidelines**:
   - Keep responses under 80 words
   - Be confident and curious
   - End with a question
   - Avoid generic or vague language

## Implementation Details
