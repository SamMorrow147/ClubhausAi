# Hallucination Fix Summary

## üêõ Issue Description

The bot was hallucinating information about projects that don't exist, specifically claiming to have built a website for Experience Maple Grove when no such website was documented in the knowledge base.

**Example of the hallucination:**
```
Bot: "We're a creative agency based in Minneapolis, MN. We specialize in brand identity, web design, AI-assisted development, and creative strategy. We've worked with a variety of clients, from destination marketing organizations to local businesses. One of our favorite projects is actually a website we built for a DMO in Maple Grove, MN. Would you like to hear more about it?"
```

**Problem:** The bot claimed to have built a website for Experience Maple Grove, but the knowledge base only mentions "Year-round creative and digital marketing for a DMO, including Restaurant Week and Winter Fest" - no website is mentioned.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **AI model hallucination**:

1. **Insufficient Constraints**: The system prompt didn't have strong enough constraints against making up information
2. **Knowledge Base Gaps**: The model was filling in gaps with plausible but false information
3. **Lack of Verification**: No mechanism to verify claims against the actual knowledge base
4. **Confidence vs Accuracy**: The model was confident in its responses but not accurate

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompt**
Added explicit instructions to prevent hallucination:

```typescript
CRITICAL: NEVER mention projects, websites, or work that isn't explicitly documented in the knowledge base. For Experience Maple Grove, ONLY mention "Year-round creative and digital marketing for a DMO, including Restaurant Week and Winter Fest" - NEVER claim we built a website for them.
```

### 2. **Strategic Response Guidelines**
Added three new guidelines to the existing framework:

- **NO HALLUCINATION**: NEVER mention projects, websites, or work that isn't explicitly documented in the knowledge base
- **STRICT ACCURACY**: If the knowledge base doesn't mention a website for a client, don't say we built one
- **VERIFY BEFORE CLAIMING**: Only claim work that's specifically documented in the knowledge base

### 3. **Specific Client Instructions**
Added explicit instructions for Experience Maple Grove:

- **EXPERIENCE MAPLE GROVE SPECIFIC**: For Experience Maple Grove, ONLY mention "Year-round creative and digital marketing for a DMO, including Restaurant Week and Winter Fest" - NEVER mention a website

## üß™ Verification

### ‚úÖ What the Knowledge Base Actually Says
```
Experience Maple Grove: Year-round creative and digital marketing for a DMO (Destination Marketing Organization) in Maple Grove, including Restaurant Week and Winter Fest. Shows our ability to handle large-scale, multi-platform campaigns for tourism and destination marketing.
```

### ‚ùå What the Bot Was Claiming
```
"One of our favorite projects is actually a website we built for a DMO in Maple Grove, MN"
```

### ‚úÖ What the Bot Should Say Now
```
"One of our favorite projects is actually the year-round creative and digital marketing we do for Experience Maple Grove, a DMO in Maple Grove, MN, including their Restaurant Week and Winter Fest campaigns."
```

## üîß Technical Details

```

### After (Accurate):
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are the Clubhaus AI assistant...

CRITICAL: NEVER mention projects, websites, or work that isn't explicitly documented in the knowledge base. For Experience Maple Grove, ONLY mention "Year-round creative and digital marketing for a DMO, including Restaurant Week and Winter Fest" - NEVER claim we built a website for them.`

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

The fix ensures:
- ‚úÖ Bot only mentions work that's explicitly documented

## üéØ Future Prevention

This fix establishes a framework for preventing similar issues:
1. **Documentation First**: Only claim work that's documented
